# Advent of Code 2018

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/about) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language. 

This repo is my personal attempt at solving **some** of the [Advent of Code 2018](http://adventofcode.com/2018) problems using T-SQL.
